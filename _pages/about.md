Hi there! I am a 4th year Ph.D. candidate (expected to graduate by Aug 2023) in the Institute of Data Science at the National University of Singapore, where I study machine learning for speech processing with my supervisor Prof. [Haizhou Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z8_x7C8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). During my Ph.D., I have also conducted research at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL) with Dr. [Jonathan Le Roux](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aUpxty8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and the University of Bremen with Prof. [Tanja Schultz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CupDmmcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 


My research focuses on mimicking human auditory attention to develop more generalizable speech extraction algorithms in solving the [cocktail party problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect). I am particularly interested in utilizing visual cues such as lip movements and co-speech gestures, or using the brain elicited neuronal response such as EEG signals.


Besides research, I love a lot of things! Basketball holds a special place in my heart, for the joy it brings, and the camaraderie and strong bonds fostered within a team. I also love traveling to experience different cultures and breathtaking natural landscapes. I was born in Qiqihar, a city in China famous for the red-crowned crane and full of snow, I love snowboarding and winter fishing. I spend my youth years in Singapore and I love scuba diving and surfing in its neighboring islands.  

Grab a üç∫ and cheers!

Life is an interesting journey. You never know where it will take you. Peaks and valleys, twists and turns. You can get the surprise of your life. Sometimes on the way to where you're going, you might think "This is the worst time of my life" but you know what? At the end of the road, through all the adversity if you can get where you wanted to be, you will remember "whatever doesn't kill you make you stronger" and all the adversity would've been worth it... Be thankful for the life we got.
